The traditional image of robots is one of mechanical humans with creepy eyes and a robotic voice. However, real-life robots are not as advanced as this depiction suggests. They are programmed to perform specific tasks and lack human creativity. For example, an autonomous car will follow its programming without considering traffic or changing course to avoid accidents. This limitation is what artificial intelligence (AI) aims to overcome. AI is designed to simulate the complex thinking and problem-solving abilities of the human mind. The concept of AI dates back to 1950 with Alan Turing's Turing test, followed by the creation of chatbots like ELIZA in the 1960s. Other notable milestones include IBM Deep Blue's chess victories in the 1970s and Apple's introduction of Siri in 2011. In recent years, companies like OpenAI have been founded to push the boundaries of AI development.
